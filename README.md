## Recipe Capture
## React Native iOS application using image recognition to serve a user recipes including the ingredients they've photographed

- A fully featured application with the ability to set all your personal preferences and restrictions like diets, allergies, intolerances, and much more.

- By combining the power of Clarifai and Spoonacular, we deliver a unique experience to the user as well as the ability to find recipes for anything they've got in the house.
